//! Lazy device reads shared by the DPI, SmartShift, and Profiles panels.
//!
//! These panels resolve their state by sending a one-shot read request to the
//! agent over IPC and awaiting the typed reply off the render thread, then
//! storing the result — or clearing the loading marker if the reply never
//! comes. Only the command, the store action, and the clear action differ; the
//! panels inject them as their own `AppState` method references.

/// Issue a one-shot device read over IPC and apply its typed result to

/// `make_command` builds the read [`Command`] from the route and reply channel
/// (e.g. [`Command::ReadDpi`]); `store` applies a delivered result (e.g.
/// [`AppState::store_dpi_info`]); `clear` resets the loading marker when the
/// reply is dropped (e.g. `|state, key| state.reads.dpi.clear_loading(key)`).
/// The caller marks the loading state first for an initial load, or skips it
/// for a post-write confirm re-read so the optimistic value stays on screen
/// until the real one lands.
